### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    I really enjoyed lab 1 mostly because it was the beginning of my learning process about coding. I have had no prior experience with programming whatsoever, so the simple “Hello” program that we did was my introduction to it. Because of this it was definitely a highlight for me this semester since it helped spark my interest, since then.


* Lab 5

    Being able to do lab 5 part 2 was not only very interesting, but also very fun. I have always been very into blackjack and the fact that now I had a chance to make a program for it was an exciting challenge. It also taught me how fun prompting can be when you get to choose what user answers lead to what outcomes.


* Lab 8

    Lab 8 was by far one of the most confusing labs I’ve done. Since instead of information or numbers, we needed to produce a specific pattern. The reason why I liked this one though, was because both me and my partner went through the entire trial and error process until we eventually managed to figure it out, and it was such a cool moment.
